# ThinkBayes_Julia
Following A. B. Downey's book [*Think Bayes*](http://allendowney.github.io/ThinkBayes2/index.html), but using Julia as opposed to Python. Notebooks are split into relevant chapters. Not all chapters needed a notebook with a code, not all problems in chapters needed coding.

Two aims here. To become more familiar with Bayesian statistics and to practice with Julia
